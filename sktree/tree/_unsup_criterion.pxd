# class, with the exception of the type of the internal structure.
# In scikit-learn, they store a buffer for the y-labels, whereas here
# we store a buffer for the X dataset. 
#
# In our criterions, we do not store the 'y-labels' because there are none
# in unsupervised learning. We instead store a memview of the dataset 'X'.

    # -------
    # The 'init' method is copied here with the almost the exact same signature
